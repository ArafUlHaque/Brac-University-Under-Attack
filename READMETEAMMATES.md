As Cisco Packet Tracer uses binary files (pka/pkt), we must make sure that only one of us are working on the pkt file. One of us will work on the file, push it in the repo, then another one of us will pull the new update pkt file and so on and so forth.
I am repeating again PLEASE PUSH AND PULL PROPERLY!!!

I will name the first version of the file v0. When you guys upload your version, update the version number (v1,v2,v3,...). It will be a bit reduntant as we will have many versions of the same project but if a mistake happens we can easily rollback.

These will be the folders:
/Documentation      (Reports, tables, VLSM charts)
/Scripts            (Text files containing the CLI commands for each router)
/Topology           (The .pkt files)
README.md           (Project constraints and tasks)


Instead of just clicking in Packet Tracer, write your configurations in Notepad/Text Editor first.
Save these as CSE_Router_Config.txt, Admin_Router_Config.txt, etc., in the /Scripts folder.
